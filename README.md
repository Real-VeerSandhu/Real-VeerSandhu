## Abstract

**Greetings.** I'm Veer, a Computer Science student at the University of Waterloo with a passion for leveraging mathematics, AI, and software engineering principles to build data-driven technology. My experience spans:
- Deep Learning & Machine Learning
- Full Stack Web Development
- Data Science
- Data Engineering
- Low-Level Programming

## Tech Stack
- Python (Tensorflow, Vertex AI, OpenCV, Keras, Scikit Learn, Pandas, Airflow, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Flask, Streamlit)
- Javascript & Typescript (Angular, React, NextJS, Express, SocketIO)
- C, C++
- Heroku, Firebase, GCP (GCS, BigQuery, Dataflow, Composer, Cloud Run)

## Philosophy
I believe in a **first-principles approach**â€”understanding the core principles of computing, mathematics, and problem-solving before applying higher-level abstractions. My goal is to **work from the ground up**, designing technology that drives **real business impact**.
